DOCTYPE declaration needs to be your first line
It is not considered an HTML tag as it just indicates the HTML version being used

	<!DOCTYPE html> 	(What we will be using primarely)
	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//WSC//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//WSC//DTD HTML 1.0 Strict//EN""http:www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict-dtd">

Notepad++ is what we will be using

	First Page in a website is a index
	save files as HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE or .html file
	
The Web page is everything under the titlebar - called a view port

	Title shows up on the TAB

HTML comment blocks

	<!-- 
		This is a comment
	 -->

comments only appear on the page source

-There are many character sets that we can use in computing (e.g. ASCII, Latin-1, Unicode, UTF-8)

		-We specifiy the page's character set using a meta tag

-In HTML we can use meta tags to tell the browser special information about our html document

		-metadata refers to the concept of information abou other information

-The meta tag should also go within your     head 	section

<meta charset= "UTF-8" />

a meta tab is a self closing tag it doens't hold any other content
Its propterty = somthing in quotes

<meta name="keywords" content="Web, code, HTML, development" />

Meta tags are information that you are using 

You can validate your website on W3C you can paste in URL
You can file upload
Direct input which is putting in your code directly

It will give errors if you didn't do somthing
